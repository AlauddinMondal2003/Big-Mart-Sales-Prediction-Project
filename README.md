# Big Mart Sales Prediction Project
 This project aims to predict the sales of products in different outlets of a retail chain, using machine learning, specifically the XGBoost Regressor model.  Steps:  Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the sales data from a CSV file (train.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame. It handles missing values in the dataset, explores the data statistically, and visualizes the data distribution using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the patterns in the data. Feature Engineering and Encoding: Categorical features are converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding, making the data suitable for the machine learning model. Model Training and Evaluation: The data is split into training and testing sets. The XGBoost Regressor model is trained using the training data and evaluated on both the training and testing sets. The model's performance is measured using the R-squared metric, which indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). Data Analysis:  The project includes extensive analysis of the data:  Handling missing values: missing values in 'Item_Weight' and 'Outlet_Size' columns are filled using mean and mode respectively Data distribution: The distribution of numerical features like 'Item_Weight', 'Item_Visibility', 'Item_MRP', and 'Item_Outlet_Sales' is visualized. Categorical features: Frequency of different categories in 'Item_Fat_Content', 'Item_Type', 'Outlet_Size', and 'Outlet_Establishment_Year' are examined. Outcome:  The project concludes by presenting the R-squared values for the training and test data, which represent the model's accuracy in predicting sales on unseen data.  Goal:  The ultimate goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict future sales for the retail chain, allowing for better inventory management and business strategies.
